## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DagiiM/webops.git
cd webops

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cd control-panel
./venv/bin/python manage.py test

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Code Style

#### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with strict type checking using **Pyright**:

* **Python Version**: 3.11+
* **Django Version**: 5.0+
* **Type Checking**: Pyright in strict mode
* **Maximum line length**: 100 characters
* **Type hints**: Required for all function signatures
* **Docstrings**: Google-style Python docstrings with type information
* **String formatting**: Use f-strings
* **Import order**: stdlib, third-party, local (separated by blank lines)

**Pyright Configuration** (`pyrightconfig.json`):
```json
{
    "typeCheckingMode": "strict",
    "reportMissingTypeStubs": false,
    "reportUnknownMemberType": false
}
```

Example:
```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any, Self
from pathlib import Path

from django.db import models
from celery import shared_task

from apps.core.models import BaseModel


def deploy_application(
    repo_url: str,
    branch: str = "main",
    env_vars: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Deploy application from GitHub repository.

    Args:
        repo_url: GitHub repository URL
        branch: Git branch to deploy
        env_vars: Environment variables for the application

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing deployment result with status and metadata.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If repo_url is invalid.
        ConnectionError: If unable to connect to repository.
    """
    if env_vars is None:
        env_vars = {}

    # Implementation here
    return {"status": "success", "deployment_id": "abc123"}


class DeploymentRepository:
    """A data access layer for deployment operations."""

    def __init__(self: Self, connection: models.Model) -> None:
        """Initialize the repository with a database connection.

        Args:
            connection: An active database connection object.
        """
        self.connection = connection
```
```

#### Frontend Style Guide

* **HTML**: Use semantic HTML5 elements
* **CSS**: Pure CSS3, no frameworks or preprocessors - implement custom CSS design system
* **JavaScript**: Vanilla ES6+, no frameworks or build tools
* **Icons**: Use SVG icons exclusively (no emojis)
* **Styling**: Consistent custom CSS design system with CSS variables for theming

Example:
```javascript
'use strict';

class DeploymentManager {
    constructor() {
        this.csrfToken = document.querySelector('[name=csrfmiddlewaretoken]').value;
    }

    async deployApp(formData) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('/api/deployments/', {
                method: 'POST',
                credentials: 'same-origin',
                headers: {
                    'X-CSRFToken': this.csrfToken,
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                },
                body: JSON.stringify(formData),
            });

            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
            }

            return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Deployment failed:', error);
            throw error;
        }
    }
}
```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")

Example:
```
