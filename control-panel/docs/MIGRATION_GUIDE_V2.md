# Migration Guide: v1.0.7 ‚Üí v2.0.0

This guide helps you migrate from WebOps v1.0.7 to the upcoming v2.0.0 release.

---

## Overview

Version 2.0.0 will remove deprecated APIs and introduce some breaking changes. This guide ensures a smooth migration.

**Current Version:** 1.0.7
**Target Version:** 2.0.0 (planned)
**Estimated Release:** Q2 2026

---

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Deprecated Branding Methods Removed

#### What's Changing
Two internal methods in `BrandingSettings` model will be removed:
- `_apply_theme_preset()`
- `_generate_hex_colors()`

#### Migration Path

**Before (v1.0.7 - deprecated):**
```python
from apps.core.branding.models import BrandingSettings

settings = BrandingSettings.objects.first()
settings._apply_theme_preset()      # DeprecationWarning
settings._generate_hex_colors()     # DeprecationWarning
```

**After (v2.0.0):**
```python
from apps.core.branding.services import BrandingService
from apps.core.branding.models import BrandingSettings

settings = BrandingSettings.objects.first()

# Apply theme preset
preset = BrandingService.apply_theme_preset(settings.theme_preset)
if preset:
    for key, value in preset.items():
        if hasattr(settings, key):
            setattr(settings, key, value)
    settings.save()

# Generate hex colors
settings.primary_color = BrandingService.hsl_to_hex(
    settings.primary_hue,
    settings.primary_saturation,
    settings.primary_lightness
)
settings.save()
```

#### Timeline
- **v1.0.7:** Methods deprecated with warnings
- **v1.1.x:** Warnings continue (grace period)
- **v2.0.0:** Methods removed

#### Impact
**Low** - These are internal methods rarely used outside the model.

---

### 2. Backward Compatibility Layer Removal (Planned)

#### What's Changing
The backward compatibility re-exports in `/apps/core/` may be removed:
- `apps/core/models.py` re-exports
- `apps/core/forms.py` re-exports
- `apps/core/views.py` re-exports

#### Migration Path

**Before (v1.0.7 - still works):**
```python
from apps.core.models import BrandingSettings
from apps.core.forms import DatabaseForm
from apps.core.views import some_view
```

**After (v2.0.0 - preferred):**
```python
from apps.core.branding.models import BrandingSettings
from apps.databases.forms import DatabaseForm
from apps.core.branding.views import some_view
```

#### Timeline
- **v1.0.7:** Both old and new imports work
- **v1.1.x:** Deprecation warnings added to old imports
- **v2.0.0:** Old imports removed

#### Impact
**Medium** - May affect many imports, but automated migration possible.

#### Automated Migration
```bash
# Use this script to update imports (v2.0.0 release will include this)
python manage.py migrate_imports --dry-run
python manage.py migrate_imports --apply
```

## Deprecation Warnings

### How to Find Deprecated Usage

Run your code with deprecation warnings enabled:

```bash
# Python 3.11+
python -W default::DeprecationWarning manage.py runserver

# Or in code
import warnings
warnings.simplefilter('default', DeprecationWarning)
```

### Common Warning Messages

```
DeprecationWarning: _apply_theme_preset() is deprecated and will be removed
in version 2.0. Use BrandingService.apply_theme_preset() instead.
```

**Action:** Update to use `BrandingService.apply_theme_preset()`

```
DeprecationWarning: _generate_hex_colors() is deprecated and will be removed
in version 2.0. Use BrandingService.hsl_to_hex() instead.
```

**Action:** Update to use `BrandingService.hsl_to_hex()`
