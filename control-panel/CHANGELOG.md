## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7

**No breaking changes!** This release only removes internal legacy code.

#### If you were using `database_create_legacy` URL:
- **Action Required:** Use `/databases/create/` instead
- **Why:** Legacy route removed for security (no validation)
- **New route:** Properly validates all fields and checks dependencies

#### If you have custom code calling deprecated methods:
```python
# Before (deprecated)
settings._apply_theme_preset()
settings._generate_hex_colors()

# After (recommended)
from apps.core.branding.services import BrandingService

preset = BrandingService.apply_theme_preset(settings.theme_preset)
hex_color = BrandingService.hsl_to_hex(hue, saturation, lightness)
```

**Timeline:** Deprecated methods will be removed in v2.0.0

### Migrating to v2.0.0 (Future)

See [MIGRATION_GUIDE_V2.md](docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE_V2.md) for detailed migration instructions.
